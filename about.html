  <h2>About Carlos</h2>
  <p>I've been designing all kinds of websites since 2004. Currently I work as a UI Designer for <a href="http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/">Lightspeed Systems</a>, where I help develop an awesome social e-learning platform called <a href="http://mybigcampus.com/">My Big Campus</a>. Before that, I worked for a while with the fine folks of <a href="http://horsepower.com/">Horsepower.com</a>, where we connected farmers with consumers. You can see my complete work history on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/cuellarllar/">Linkedin profile</a>.</p>

  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>This is basically a weblog where the author writes random notes about design, technology, music, etc. I also keep a collection of links, some of them recovered from my old Delicious account.</p>
  <p>This site is made with some of the latest web standards from the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. The publishing system used is <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a>, a powerful and flexible <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, and the styles are based on <a href="https://github.com/cuellarllar/txp.smacss">txp.smacss</a>, a barebones Textpattern theme using Bourbon and Neat and following SMACSS guidelines. All the code and markup on this site are made with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a>, my favorite text editor for OS X, and all the graphics have been created with Bohemian Coding's <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>.</p>
  <p>This site has been tested and is supported in modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Opera (11+), Internet Explorer (9+) and Firefox (4+).</p>
