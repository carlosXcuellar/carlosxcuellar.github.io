I just migrated the content of this blog to "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com. I've been using "Textpattern":http://textpattern.com as my CMS of choice for years, but I wanted to try something new and my blog is the perfect place to experiment.

The process has been pretty smooth and I'm surprised of how easy it was to migrate the old content, posts and links. I might miss some things from TXP, like having a nice back-end or a search engine built-in, but it should be easier to tweak the design of this site using Jekyll and the workflow is very similar to the one I use at work. I am also hosting this in "GitHub Pages":https://pages.github.com/, what makes everything even easier.

Anyway, I'm giving this thing a try for the next few weeks. I'll keep changing things here and there and if I don't like it I can always go back to _good ol'_ Textpattern.
