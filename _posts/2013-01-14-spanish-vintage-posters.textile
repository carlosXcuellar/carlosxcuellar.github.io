More posters, these ones from the "National Library of Spain's":http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/Search.do?text=&showYearItems=&exact=&textH=&advanced=&completeText=&destacadas1=Carteles%20publicitarios&pageNumber=3&pageSize=10&language=es archives. They have tons of classic bullfight stuff, but also some interesting advertising posters.
