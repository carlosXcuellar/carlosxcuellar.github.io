I'm doing some usability testing at work and I just discovered that "Silverback":http://silverbackapp.com/, the screen capture software I used before, doesn't work anymore in my new Macbook. Looking for an alternative I found "Lookback":https://lookback.io/. It's simple, multi-platform (Mac, iOS and Android), and it uploads your recordings to the cloud so you can share them with the rest of your team.
