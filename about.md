I've been designing all kinds of websites since 2004. Currently I work as a UI Designer for Lightspeed Systems, where I help develop an awesome social e-learning platform called My Big Campus. Before that, I worked for a while with the fine folks of Horsepower.com, where we connected farmers with consumers. You can see my complete work history on my Linkedin profile.

If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to send me an email.

### About this site
This is basically a weblog where the author writes random notes about design, technology, music, etc. I also keep a collection of links, some of them recovered from my old Delicious account.

This site is made with some of the latest web standards from the W3C. The publishing system used is Textpattern, a powerful and flexible CMS, and the styles are based on txp.smacss, a barebones Textpattern theme using Bourbon and Neat and following SMACSS guidelines. All the code and markup on this site are made with Sublime Text 2, my favorite text editor for OS X, and all the graphics have been created with Bohemian Coding's Sketch.

This site has been tested and is supported in modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Opera (11+), Internet Explorer (9+) and Firefox (4+).
