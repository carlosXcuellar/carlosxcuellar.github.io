  <h2 class="clear">Site Colophon</h2>
  <p>This site is a showcase of some of my work and it's also a blog where I write random notes about design, music, technology, etc. I also keep a collection of links, some of them recovered from my old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)">Delicious</a> account.</p>
  <p>The first <a href="/blog/archive">blog posts</a> are from 2004 and at that time I was using <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> as my publishing platform. After that, I used <a href="https://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> for years as my CMS of choice and right now I'm using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate this site and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host it.  There's a <a href="https://github.com/cuellarfr/cuellarfr.github.io">GitHub repository</a> where you can check the source code of this site.</p>
  <p>All the code and markup were made on <a href="https://macromates.com">TextMate</a>, wireframes, mockups, icons and other vector graphics were created on <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Bohemian Coding's Sketch</a>, and when I needed to edit bitmap images I used <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Flying Meat's Acorn</a>. The typeface you're seeing is <a href="https://github.com/IBM/plex">IBM's Plex Sans</a>, which is excellent and open source.</p>
  <p>This site has been tested and is supported in modern and ancient browsers like Chrome, Safari, Opera (11+), Internet Explorer (9+) and Firefox (4+).</p>
