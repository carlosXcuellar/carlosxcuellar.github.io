Since 2002, __Goldstar Events__ has sold discounted tickets for live entertainment. One of the things that made Goldstar different is that their customers don't select a specific seat at checkout and they instead let Goldstar pick the best seats available at a given price range. But in 2016 Goldstar decided that they were going to offer _premium_ tickets where users have the ability to select their seats. The technology that made this possible was created from scratch and it's still today a work in progress.

My contribution to this project started with a series of interviews with stakeholders in order to define the business requirements. After that, I finished two proto-personas that were used during the whole project and I collaborated on the creation of an initial story map.

The research process continued with a competitive analysis of eight other ticketing companies that were already using interactive seating charts. I tried to find the strengths and weaknesses of each other and I tried to incorporate some of their solutions after evaluating with our engineers if it was technically feasible.

All this information was used in the ideation of 3 initial low fidelity prototypes. These prototypes were first tested casually by some coworkers and then by a selection of our customers. The results of this usability testing were used to create a fourth prototype that was tested again for another group of customers. This iterative process was repeated several times until I found an optimal solution after <a href="/work/seat-mobile-proto/index.html#/screens">prototype number 10<a>.

Our final prototype included several features that we weren't technically able to implement at once and that's why I had to create several <a href="/work/seat-mobile-proto-temp/index.html#/screens">intermediate solutions</a> that were used temporarily for several months. These solutions, along with a <a href="/work/seat-desktop-proto/index.html#/screens">desktop version</a>, were implemented in a limited amount of events that allowed us to compile information and feedback from users in a process that lasted more than 6 months.
