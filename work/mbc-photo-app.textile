Smartphones are an essential part of modern life and today they are integrated into many classrooms. This project maximized the potential of the smartphone at school, turning it into an educational tool.

We generated ideas around the possible uses of smartphones by our personas, then we filtered the best ones and used them to create usage scenarios. After that, I built some paper prototypes that allowed us to test basic interactions. The next step was to create an "interactive prototype":/work/photoapp_proto-student_v2.pdf and several task flows showing the use of the app by parents, students and educators.

The final result was a safe and monitored app, similar to Instagram and used by students to share pictures with the rest of their classmates.
