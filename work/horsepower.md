When I joined <a href="http://www.horsepower.com">Horsepower</a>, the development team already had a functional website with all the core features available and a minimalist style. My first task consisted of creating a new corporate brand showing the company's values, and I also wrote a style guide that was used by the rest of the developers and marketing team.

This website was sponsored by the Friend family, farmers based in Tulare, California. The Friends already had a successful experience with a prior non-web version of Horsepower, so they had a solid idea of the business goals and an extensive knowledge of our customers. With the information they provided, we added new features to the site and we reimagined the user experience, culminating with the release of a new version of the site just six months after I joined the team.

Some quick tech notes: the website was developed using <a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> and the front-end I implemented was based on the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework from Twitter, which was new at that time.
