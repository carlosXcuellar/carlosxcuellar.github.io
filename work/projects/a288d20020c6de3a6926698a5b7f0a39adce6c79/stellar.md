In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the live entertainment industry early and hard, and my employer Goldstar Events was no exception. We stopped selling tickets for live events and our revenue plummeted. With no certainties about when and how we would get back to regular sales, we had to pivot and find new paths for the company.

It is in this context that we found a new market opportunity in the streaming of online events. In the last few months, weâ€™ve seen a surge of online, home-produced events, but they use streaming platforms that were not designed for this use case, and the user experience is far from smooth. We found that we could provide a professional platform for event organizers that would allow them to sell tickets, manage marketing and customer service, and produce premium quality streams, all in one place.

A small team of 15 people started working on this new platform, and after a couple of months of hard work, Stellar was born! I was in charge of the design of the organizer site, where we allow event organizers to create events and inventories, manage ticket transactions, and produce a professional streaming signal for their customers.

We designed the IA and flows based on stakeholder assumptions that were later validated with our closest partners. I designed wireframes and prototypes that were first tested internally, and then with those same partners.

The next step is a soft launch in the summer of 2020, with apps for iOS, Android, Roku, and Apple TV. At that point, we are hoping we will be able to capture a lot of data and user feedback that will allow us to iterate and refine the platform.
