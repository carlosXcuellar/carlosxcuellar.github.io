I am a certified User Experience Designer with an industrial design background and some love for front-end web development. I have been creating experiences that simplify users’ lives since 2006. I'm an advocate of design as a problem solving discipline and I use empathy as a primary skill.</p>
  <h2>Where I work</h2>
  <p>I started my career in Spain working for marketing agencies. In 2011 I moved with my wife to California where I started working as an in-house designer for an e-commerce startup.</p>
  <p>My second american gig was at Lightspeed Systems, where I designed e-learning software for K-12 schools.</p>
  <p>I'm currently a <strong>Senior UX Designer at Goldstar Events</strong>, where I'm in charge of the marketing platform for event organizers. My main goal is to make listing events a less stressful experience for our partners.</p>

  <h2>How I work</h2>
  <p>Every project is different and I often wear different hats, but my fundamental approach to UX Design is consistent. It's a collaborative process where I work closely with a product manager during the whole process and with other designers and developers in different stages. I enjoy this approach because it's effective and I'm always learning new things. These are the steps I follow in my design process.</p>

  <h3 class="h4">1. Define the problem</h3>
  <p>As a designer, my main job is to solve problems and in order to solve them, I first need to define them exactly. In order to do that you need to ask questions to figure out the What, Why, What if, and How. Sometimes when I talk to stakeholders they already have an idea of their needs and they have even thought about UI solutions, but when I dig deep into the cause of the problem it's pretty common that the solution is something completely different than what they originally had in mind.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">2. Research</h3>
  <p>Once I have the problem defined it's time to start the research. I normally do a bit of competitive analysis in order to learn how other companies solved similar problems and later I do user observations and user interviews so I can understand their workflows, pain points, behaviors, needs, and map out use cases and scenarios.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">3. Ideation</h3>
  <p>At this stage of the process, I start looking for solutions to the problem. I normally work with product managers on a story map and after that, I immediately start sketching and creating quick wireframes that I iterate so I can explore different UI solutions. Depending on the project, these wireframes can evolve into interactive prototypes that I build using tools like <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> + <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, <a href="https://framer.com/">Framer</a> or <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">4. Critiques</h3>
  <p>Every week I run critiques with the design team and then I present my designs to stakeholders in order to get early feedback. I also share my work with developers so they can provide technical feedback.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">5. Test, iterate, test, iterate…</h3>
  <p>Once I have a working prototype I need to start testing and refining it. I normally start with a very casual testing in the office where I ask some coworkers to complete tasks in order to find the most obvious usability issues. After that, I'll prepare some usability testing sessions with real users or users with a profile similar to our personas. I typically prefer in-person usability testing because it allows me to interact with users and ask follow-up questions. However, this can be time-consuming and sometimes I just use remote testing using services like <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting</a>. Once I analyze and extract the test results I use this feedback to improve the prototype, and once it's done I test it again. The process is repeated until I reach an optimal solution for both users and stakeholders.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">6. Implement a solution</h3>
  <p>Lastly, I work with visual designers and front-end engineers during the final implementation of the solution. The result is often deployed for a few users using some kind of A/B testing. I use web analytics and user feedback in the last round of refinement of the product.</p>
