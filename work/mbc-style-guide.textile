"My Big Campus":http://www.mybigcampus.com is a project of a respectable size that has been adding new features (that could be considered stand-alone product by themselves) in a yearly base, sometimes implemented by different teams. As a result, we found that there was a lack of design consistence across the site, and the CSS code wasn't efficient enough or <acronym title="Don't Repeaty Yourself">DRY</acronym>.

At that point we realized we had to make some changes, promote a more consistent design and refactor our CSS. The best way we found to establish and promote good practice was to use a live style guide. We used the same software GitHub used for their "Style Guide":https://github.com/styleguide/css, and that software allowed us to update our guide automatically after changing anything on the CSS of the site.

About the CSS, after a failed experiment with a popular UI framework, we decided to build our own framework following the "SMACSS":https://smacss.com/ methodology for the structure, and the "BEM":https://en.bem.info/ naming convention for the styles naming. You can learn more about the refactor process in this "blog post":/blog/i-refactored-css-for-9-months-and-i-survived/ I wrote a few months ago.

The final result was a stylesheet file that was 70% lighter and 1.5 seconds faster than the original one.
