    <p>My name is Carlos Cu√©llar and I'm an Interaction Designer living and working in Portland, Oregon.</p>
    <p>I've been designing all kind of digital experiences since 2004 and I currently work for <a href="https://www.goldstar.com">Goldstar Events</a> where I help people go out more. I'm an advocate of design as a problem solving discipline and I use empathy as a primary skill.</p>
    <p>When not staring at a screen, I listen to classic alternative rock music records (yes, that means I'm getting old) and I try to find happy hours in downtown Portland.</p>
    <p>You can say hola to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/cuellarfr">Twitter</a>, catch me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cuellarfr">Linkedin</a> or send me an <a href="mailto:hola@carloscuellar.net">email</a>.</p>
